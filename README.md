# juice-shop_server
This is repo where I will logging my learning of graphql-server.

[Link to the server](https://juiceshop-graphql.herokuapp.com/graphql)

### 1st Iteration ðŸ¦ :
Installing and using was no big deal, but the declaring schema or even finding documents or tutorials that did not have "apollo" was tough to find.

#### Work Flow:
1. Installed necessary packages:
    1. node
    2. graphql
    3. express
    4. express-graphql
    5. mysql
2. Connected MySQL server
3. [Created "Hollow World"](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/)
4. Add schema and some mocked data to tryout GraphQi (the gui to test and see schema)
5. Replace mocked data with MySQL procedural call.
